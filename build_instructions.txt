To build the binary for linux, first you need to manually initialize the go module and download the dependencies. Run the following commands in your terminal:
```
go mod init go-rod-testing-browser-restrict
go mod tidy
```

Then, to build the binary, run the following command:
```
make build
```

This will create a binary named `go-rod-testing-browser-restrict` in the current directory.
